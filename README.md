## 🔭 What’s Next — Dynamic & Efficient

This project will be **converted to a modern web framework** for dynamic content and **memory/latency efficiency**:

### Framework Direction

- **Next.js / Remix / SvelteKit** (final pick TBD)
- **Server Components / SSR / ISR** for fast, cacheable pages
- **Edge Functions** (Vercel/Netlify) to reduce latency near users

### Memory & Latency Efficiency

- **Code-splitting** & route-level lazy-loading
- **Image optimization** (next/image or equivalent, AVIF/WebP)
- **Caching strategy**: HTTP cache-control, stale-while-revalidate, CDN keys
- **Minimal JS** on the client; zero-cost server components where possible
- **Connection-level efficiency**: HTTP/2/3, Brotli, preconnect, preload
- **Runtime monitoring**: memory budgets, performance tracing

### Data & Integrations

- CMS options (Sanity/Contentful/Headless WP) for editable content
- ATS/HRIS integration (Greenhouse/Lever/Taleo or webhooks)
- Email forms via serverless handlers (with spam protection)

---

## 📱 Mobile & Viewports Optimization

- **Fluid, responsive layout** (mobile-first)
- **Adaptive typography** (clamp(), container queries)
- **Touch targets & accessible focus states**
- **PWA baseline**: installable icon set, offline shell (planned)
- **Lighthouse targets**: 95+ Performance/Accessibility/Best Practices/SEO

---

## 🧪 Quality & Accessibility

- **WCAG 2.1 AA** targets: color contrast, keyboard nav, ARIA landmarks
- **Analytics** with consent (cookieless optional)
- **Error boundaries** & friendly empty states
